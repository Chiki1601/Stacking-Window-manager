<h3>Stacking Window Manager</h3>
<div class="credit">(Proposed by Marian Veteanu)</div>

<p>
This coding challenge will take you back to the early days of microcomputers and put you in the race to build the next user interface for a micro.
In practical terms you’re asked to implement a <b>mini stacking window manager</b> using <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>HTML5 CANVAS</b>.
</p>

<p>
The design is all yours! Please feel free to be original … or just leverage your knowledge from other operating systems GUI programming to implement this.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>Important</u></b>: Try to time-box this project. Unless you plan to build the next Windows / Mac UI, try not to spend more than 1 – 2 evenings on this coding challenge.
Focus only on the features that you believe are important to you… 
</p>

<p>
When you send the solution, please describe:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Features of your Window Manager</li>
<li>The main idea behind your design</li>
<li>What is the developer experience for the user of your GUI system / library</li>
</ul>

About my implementation...
</summary>

<p>
My implementation is quite basic, a far cry from a real-life, Windows-like front-end.
<br>
But in any case, below I’ve enumerated the main features:
</p>

<h4>Stacking</h4>

<ul>
<li>Windows are stacked on top of each other</li>
<li>You can make any window top-most, by clicking on it</li>
<li>The active window stands out visually, by using a different color scheme</li>
<li>You can close any window</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dragging</h4>

<ul>
<li>You can move any window by dragging its title bar</li>
<li>Over the title bar, the mouse cursor becomes a "move" shape</li>
</ul>

<h4>Resizing</h4>

<ul>
<li>You can resize any window, by dragging borders and corners</li>
<li>All four borders, and all four corners can be dragged</li>
<li>Over borders and corners, the mouse cursor becomes a "resize" shape</li>
</ul>

<h4>Painting</h4>

<ul>
<li>Windows are responsible for painting their <b>frame</b> (title bar, close button, and borders)</li>
<li>They receive a <b>translated</b> and <b>clipped</b> paint context:

<ul>
<li>Their upper-left corner is seen at coordinates <code>(0, 0)</code> -- no matter their actual position on the canvas</li>
<li>They cannot paint outside their area, even if they try to</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To paint the client area, they receive an optional, developer-provided paint function (see below)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Developer experience</h4>

<ul>
<li>Developer is responsible for painting the <b>client area</b> of the windows</li>
<li>They can provide a callback function, which is called by the windows manager when painting is due</li>
<li>The callback receives a paint context which is <b>translated</b> and <b>clipped</b>:

<ul>
<li>The client area’s upper-left corner is seen at coordinates <code>(0, 0)</code> -- no matter the window’s actual position on screen</li>
<li>The callback cannot paint outside of the client area, even if it tried to</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<h4>Callback paint function</h4>

<ul>
<li>As an example, I’ve provided a paint function which does the following:

<ul>
<li>Creates a random number of balls</li>
<li>Bounces the balls around, using random speeds for horizontal/vertical movement</li>
<li>The balls have random radiuses, colors, and are created at random coordinates inside the client area</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
